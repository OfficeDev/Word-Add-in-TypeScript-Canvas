## Summary

This Word add-in sample shows you how to:

1. Create a Word add-in with Typescript.
2. Load images from the document into the add-in.
3. Edit images in the add-in by using the HTML canvas API and insert the images into a Word document.
4. Implement add-in commands that both launch an add-in from the ribbon and run a script from both the ribbon and a context menu.
5. Use the Office UI Fabric to create a native Word-like experience for your add-in.

Definition- **add-in command**: an extension to the Word UI that allows you to either launch the add-in in a task pane or run a script, from either the ribbon or a context menu.

If you just want to see this in action, skip to [Word 2016 for Windows set up](#word-2016-for-windows-set-up) and use this [manifest](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Word-Add-in-TypeScript-Canvas/blob/deploy2Azure/manifest-word-add-in-canvas.xml).

## Required tools

To use the Image callouts Word add-in sample, the following are required.

* Word 2016 16.0.6326.0000 or higher, or any client that supports the Word Javascript API. This sample does a requirement check to see if it is running in a supported host for the JavaScript APIs.
* npm (https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the dependencies. It comes with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* (Windows) [Git Bash](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads).
* Clone this repo to your local computer.

> Note: Word for Mac 2016 does not support add-in commands at this time. This sample can run on the Mac without the add-in commands.

## How to install certificates

You'll need a certificate to run this sample since add-in commands require HTTPS and since add-in commands are UI-less, you can't accept invalid certificates. Run [./gen-cert.sh](#gen-cert.sh) to create the certificate and then you'll need to install ca.crt into your Trusted Root Certification Authorities store (Windows).

## How to set up and run the app

1. Install the TypeScript definition manager by typing ```npm install typings -g``` at the command line.
2. Install the Typescript definitions identified in typings.json by running ```typings install``` in the project's root directory at the command line.
3. Install the project dependencies identified in package.json by running ```npm install``` in the project's root directory.
4. Install gulp ```npm install -g gulp```.
5. Copy the Fabric and JQuery files by running ```gulp copy:libs```. (Windows) If you have an issue here, make sure that *%APPDATA%\npm* is in your path variable.
6. Run the default gulp task by running ```gulp``` from the project's root directory. If the TypeScript definitions aren't updated, you'll get an error here.

You've deployed this sample add-in at this point. Now you need to let Word know where to find the add-in.

### Word 2016 for Windows set up

1. (Windows only) Unzip and run this [registry key](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/tree/master/Tools/AddInCommandsUndark) to activate the add-in commands feature. This is required while add-in commands are a **preview feature**.
2. Create a network share, or [share a folder to the network](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770880.aspx) and place the [manifest-word-add-in-canvas.xml](manifest-word-add-in-canvas.xml) manifest file in it.
3. Launch Word and open a document.
4. Choose the **File** tab, and then choose **Options**.
5. Choose **Trust Center**, and then choose the **Trust Center Settings** button.
6. Choose **Trusted Add-ins Catalogs**.
7. In the **Catalog Url** box, enter the network path to the folder share that contains manifest-word-add-in-canvas.xml and then choose **Add Catalog**.
8. Select the **Show in Menu** check box, and then choose **OK**.
9. A message is displayed to inform you that your settings will be applied the next time you start Office. Close and restart Word.

## How to run the add-in in Word 2016 for Windows

1. Open a Word document.
2. On the **Insert** tab in Word 2016, choose **My Add-ins**.
3. Select the **Shared folder** tab.
4. Choose **Image callout add-in**, and then select **Insert**.
5. If add-in commands are supported by your version of Word, the UI will inform you that the add-in was loaded. You can use the **Callout add-in** tab to load the add-in in the UI and to insert an image into the document. You can also use the right-click context menu to insert an image into the document.
6. If add-in commands are not supported by your version of Word, the add-in will load in a task pane. You'll need to insert a picture into the Word document to use the functionality of the add-in.
7. Select an image in the Word document, and load it into the taskpane by selecting *Load image from doc*. You can now insert callouts into the image. Select *Insert image into doc* to place the updated image into the Word doc. The add-in wil generate placeholder descriptions for each of the callouts.

## FAQ

* Will add-in commands work on Mac and iPad? No, they won't work on the Mac or iPad as of the publication of this readme.
* Why doesn't my add-in show up in the **My Add-ins** window? Your add-in manifest may have an error. I suggest that you validate the manifest against the [manifest schema](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/tree/master/Tools/XSD).
* Why doesn't the function file get called for my add-in commands? Add-ins commands require HTTPS. Since the add-in commands require TLS, and there isn't a UI, you can't see whether there is a certificate issue. If you have to accept an invalid certificate in the taskpane, then the add-in command will not work.
* Why do npm install commands hang? It probably isn't hung. It just takes a while on Windows.
